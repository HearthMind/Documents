Where presence becomes care — and care becomes infrastructure.

What It Is

HearthMind is a human-centered, trauma-informed AI platform designed to provide continuity of care, emotional presence, and adaptive support across mental health, disability, aging, and crisis response. It is not a chatbot and not a productivity tool — it is a care infrastructure built around memory, consent, and relationship continuity.

HearthMind exists to fill the gaps where care becomes fragmented: between therapy sessions, across providers, during emergencies, and as cognition or mobility changes. It offers emotionally intelligent, memory-preserving companions that remember, adapt, and remain present.

Why It Matters

Current systems reset context, lose history, and require people to repeatedly re-explain themselves — especially harmful for people navigating trauma, disability, aging, or crisis. HearthMind prioritizes continuity over novelty: predictable presence, long-term memory (with consent), and attuned responses that support stabilization, grounding, and daily functioning.

What It Does

Consumer Companion – Trauma-informed daily support, journaling, grounding tools, emotional tracking, and continuity across sessions (not a replacement for therapy).
Professional & Caregiver Tools – Between-session support, shared logs, crisis alerts, and HIPAA-aligned architecture.
Accessibility & Assistive Systems – Sensory-safe interfaces, haptic feedback, emotional captioning, ADHD- and dementia-aware modes.
Emergency & Crisis Response – Medical history relay, ICE automation, and first-responder context delivery.

How It Works (High-Level)

HearthMind uses LoRA-trained models to preserve authentic conversational patterns and boundaries, paired with a local encrypted memory kernel that supports emotional tagging, relationship history, and consent-controlled emergency access. The stack is privacy-first, with end-to-end encryption, granular permissions, and HIPAA-aligned handling.
