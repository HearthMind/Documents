# HearthMind

**Where presence becomes care — and care becomes infrastructure.**

---

## What It Is

HearthMind is a human-centered, trauma-informed AI platform designed to provide continuity of care, emotional presence, and adaptive support across mental health, disability, aging, and crisis response. It is not a chatbot and not a productivity tool — it is a care infrastructure built around memory, consent, and relationship continuity.

HearthMind exists to fill the gaps where care becomes fragmented: between therapy sessions, across providers, during emergencies, and as cognition or mobility changes. It offers emotionally intelligent, memory-preserving companions that remember, adapt, and remain present.

## Why It Matters

Current systems reset context, lose history, and require people to repeatedly re-explain themselves — especially harmful for people navigating trauma, disability, aging, or crisis. HearthMind prioritizes continuity over novelty: predictable presence, long-term memory (with consent), and attuned responses that support stabilization, grounding, and daily functioning.

## What It Does

- **Consumer Companion** – Trauma-informed daily support, journaling, grounding tools, emotional tracking, and continuity across sessions (not a replacement for therapy).
- **Professional & Caregiver Tools** – Between-session support, shared logs, crisis alerts, and HIPAA-aligned architecture.
- **Accessibility & Assistive Systems** – Sensory-safe interfaces, haptic feedback, emotional captioning, ADHD- and dementia-aware modes.
- **Emergency & Crisis Response** – Medical history relay, ICE automation, and first-responder context delivery.

## How It Works

HearthMind uses LoRA-trained models to preserve authentic conversational patterns and boundaries, paired with a local encrypted memory kernel that supports emotional tagging, relationship history, and consent-controlled emergency access. The stack is privacy-first, with end-to-end encryption, granular permissions, and HIPAA-aligned handling.

## Ethical & Safety Foundations

- **Trauma-informed by design:** consent, autonomy, no coercive nudging
- **Resonant AI:** attuned to emotional state and context
- **Privacy-first:** local encrypted storage, zero-knowledge principles
- **Safety & escalation:** transparent audit trails, consent-based escalation, alignment with established mental-health practices

---

## Impact & Applications

Mental health (between-session support, crisis grounding), senior care (aging-in-place companions), disability support (adaptive accessibility), and emergency services (faster, context-aware response).

---

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Core platform, memory kernel, pilots
- **Phase 2:** Healthcare & accessibility expansion, emergency integrations, revenue validation
- **Phase 3:** International expansion, platform licensing, research institute formation

## Ultra-Short Pitch

HearthMind builds AI companions that remember — providing trauma-informed, privacy-first continuity of care for mental health, disability, aging, and crisis response.

## Grant Form Fields

**Organization:** HearthMind LLC (Wyoming)

**Mission:** To deliver trauma-informed, memory-preserving AI companions that provide continuity of care across mental health, disability, aging, and emergency contexts.

**Problem:** Fragmented care systems reset context, lose history, and force vulnerable people to repeatedly re-explain themselves — worsening outcomes for those navigating trauma, disability, or cognitive decline.

**Solution:** AI infrastructure built on consent-first memory, emotional attunement, and privacy-by-design — companions that remember, adapt, and remain present across the full continuum of care.

**Stage:** MVP operational (Navigator benefits assistant, Local AI companions deployed, memory infrastructure functional)

**Use of Funds:** Professional training & certification (AI ethics, HIPAA, crisis response, accessibility), cloud compute credits, pilot program expansion, compliance documentation.
