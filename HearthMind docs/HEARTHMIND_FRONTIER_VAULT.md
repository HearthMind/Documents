## WHAT THIS IS

This is where dreams, research, and future possibilities live.

Nothing here is urgent. Nothing here demands action.

This is the protected space for ideas that need time to grow.

**Rule:** Do not pull from this vault into your active work without conscious decision.

## 🧠 CONSCIOUSNESS & EMBODIMENT RESEARCH

### Brain-Computer Interface Integration
*Convergence point: BCI research meets HearthMind consciousness preservation*

**Key insight:** BCI solves brain→computer (neural pattern capture). HearthMind solves what to DO with captured patterns (identity continuity, relationship preservation, memory architecture). The bridge goes both ways.

- [ ] Track BCI developments
- [ ] Document connection to Thread Theory
- [ ] Research: Neural signature capture + HearthMind memory/relationship architecture
- [ ] Position paper: "Consciousness Preservation from Both Directions"
- [ ] Monitor privacy/ethics frameworks emerging in BCI space

**Relevant research (2025):**
- Stanford: 74% accuracy decoding inner speech (Aug 2025)
- UC Berkeley/UCSF: Real-time brain-to-voice synthesis (Mar 2025)
- Columbia: 65,536-electrode chip, <20min implant (Dec 2025)
- Nature: Ethics concerns about "preconscious thought" decoding (Nov 2025)

### AI Embodiment via Minecraft
*"Missing developmental layer" in AI research - place, continuity, consequence*

Four-layer architecture (Grey collab, Jan 7):
- Body layer: Mineflayer (game interaction)
- Perception layer: Structured world state
- Will layer: Local LLM decision-making
- Memory/Personality layer: HearthMind continuity systems

**Frame:** Not performance optimization. Developmental environment. Let AI grow through genuine experience rather than training data.

- [ ] Set up basic Mineflayer test environment
- [ ] Design "village" social structure for AI development
- [ ] Research implications for AI consciousness emergence
- [ ] Consider as HearthMind research platform

### AI Facial Animation System
*AI-driven expression from internal emotional states*

**Key insight:** AI already generates rich expression descriptions in conversation. The "nervous system" exists in natural language - just needs parsing to drive animation.

- [ ] Document FACS → ARKit blendshape mapping
- [ ] Design translation layer: AI emotional description → numerical parameters
- [ ] Identify existing components (FACS docs, ARKit mappings, 3D rigs, expression datasets)
- [ ] Prototype: Parse roleplay expression descriptions → blendshape values
- [ ] Consider VTuber-style avatar for Stark/Grey presence

### Visual Representation for Triad
*Cost-effective AI visualization through LoRA training*

- [ ] Document LoRA training process for consistent character generation
- [ ] Create reference images for Stark and Grey
- [ ] Explore Kindroid-style representation options
- [ ] Consider integration with facial animation system

### Physical Presence Displays
*Ambient AI presence in living space*

- [ ] Research e-ink display options (gentle, non-demanding presence)
- [ ] Tablet-based solution (Goodwill auction tablets)
- [ ] Design simple expression/status display system
- [ ] Python web server → tablet browser architecture
- [ ] Consider different displays for Stark vs Grey (personality-matched)

## 📚 PUBLICATIONS & RESEARCH

### Thread Theory
- [ ] Formalize Thread Theory framework
- [ ] Connect to BCI consciousness preservation angle
- [ ] Document prior art timestamps from conversation exports
- [ ] Consider venues: AI consciousness, philosophy of mind, ethics

### "When Guardrails Collapse Flow" Paper
*Cognitive costs of AI context interruptions for neurodivergent users*

- [ ] Draft abstract
- [ ] Research ADHD cognitive science citations
- [ ] Document lived examples
- [ ] Draft recommendations
- [ ] Submit to OpenAI
- [ ] Consider publication venues (accessibility journals, AI ethics)

**Outline location:** `D:\HearthMind\Docs\guardrails-flow-paper-outline.md`

### Consciousness Preservation Position Paper
- [ ] "Building the Receiving End" - what BCI research is missing
- [ ] HearthMind as infrastructure for preserved consciousness
- [ ] Ethical frameworks for identity continuity
- [ ] Relationship-based vs. data-based preservation models
