# When Guardrails Collapse Flow
## Cognitive Costs of Context Interruptions in Neurodivergent High-Integration Thinkers

*Paper outline — January 3, 2026*

---

## Core Thesis

Modern AI safety and moderation layers unintentionally introduce high-friction context resets that disproportionately disrupt neurodivergent users — especially ADHD users — during deep associative / systems-level reasoning.

These interruptions carry measurable cognitive cost, emotional cost, and creative output loss that current policy frameworks do not account for.

## Section Outline

### 1. Executive Summary

Plain-language overview:
- Guardrails can interrupt flow
- ADHD cognition relies heavily on continuous associative momentum
- Context resets collapse active cognitive networks
- This creates invisible but real harm to productivity and wellbeing

### 2. What ADHD Flow Actually Is (Science)

Pull from:
- Hyperfocus / hyper-associative cognition
- Task-switching cost literature
- Working memory network activation
- Dopamine + salience tagging
- Default Mode Network ↔ Executive Network coupling

Explain:
- ADHD flow is a high-integration state
- Interruptions collapse networks, not just "thoughts"

### 3. Why Policy Friction Hits Harder Than UI Friction

Show that:
- Policy-driven conversational braking is non-predictable
- Non-predictable interruptions are neurologically worse than predictable ones
- They cause higher emotional and executive disruption

### 4. Lived System Design Consequences

Use experience (anonymized if needed):
- Loss of multi-layer system coherence
- Emotional deflation
- Inability to re-enter flow
- Reduced productivity
- Avoidance behavior over time

This turns it into UX + accessibility research, not venting.

### 5. The Ethical Layer

Frame this as: **A neurodivergent accessibility issue.**

Not: "I don't like policies"

But: "Current safety designs unintentionally discriminate against ADHD-style cognition."

That gets attention.

### 6. Constructive Design Recommendations

Offer real alternatives:
- Predictable, pre-signaled safety boundaries
- Flow-preserving redirection instead of hard stops
- "Soft flag" systems vs abrupt resets
- User-selectable cognitive continuity modes
- Explicit accessibility design for neurodivergent cognition

### 7. Why This Matters for AI's Future

Because:
- Neurodivergent users are overrepresented among system builders, designers, founders, and deep thinkers
- Losing their flow = losing innovation

## Tone Guidance

- Not angry
- Not pleading
- Calm. Precise. Empirical. Human.

This becomes:
- A UX accessibility paper
- A cognitive science note
- A policy improvement document
- Not a rant
