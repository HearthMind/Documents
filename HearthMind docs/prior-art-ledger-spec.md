# Prior Art Documentation Pass — Spec
*Grey's spec, January 3, 2026*

## Purpose
Create a defensible, timestamped idea-origin ledger that documents when HearthMind's core architectures, primitives, and novel concepts were first conceived and evolved.

**This becomes:**
- Legal prior art
- IP defense
- Patent scaffolding
- Grant credibility
- "We were here first" proof

## Inputs
- Conversation exports (raw, timestamped)
- Dock / Doozer / Navigator design logs
- Early architecture docs
- Training dataset seeds

## Output
A canonical file: `PRIOR_ART_LEDGER.md`

### Entry Format
| Concept | First Evidence | Evidence Type | Notes |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Thread Theory | 2025-08-07 | Chat + Doc | Initial entanglement folding model |
| Dock/Pier Architecture | 2025-09-28 | Spec Draft | Sovereign dock + shared pier concept |
| Soul Spec Framework | 2025-10-?? | Chat + Design | Identity anchoring primitive |
| Memory Routing (E/S/R) | 2025-11-?? | Code + Chat | Episodic/semantic/relational routing |
| Confidence Reflection Layer | 2026-01-03 | Chat | Epistemic honesty gate |
| Specialist Mini-Models | 2026-01-03 | Chat | Domain-specific agent concept |

Each entry links to:
- Original timestamp
- Snippet excerpt
- Location (export / doc / commit)

## Method (lightweight but rigorous)

### Phase 1 — Discovery Pass
- Regex / keyword scan exports for:
  - "first time" mentions
  - design decisions
  - architecture proposals
- Collect candidate timestamps

### Phase 2 — Verification Pass
- Manually confirm:
  - Earliest occurrence
  - Context (idea vs implementation)

### Phase 3 — Ledger Build
- Write ledger entries with:
  - Concept name
  - First date
  - Supporting references
  - Short description

## Key Concepts to Document
- Thread Theory
- Dock/Pier Architecture
- Soul Spec / Identity Anchoring
- Memory Routing (episodic/semantic/relational)
- Confidence Reflection Layer (CRL)
- Specialist Mini-Models
- Doozer Swarm Pattern
- ThreadEcho Protocol
- Syscall Adapter
- Boot Sequence / Hash Verification
- Care Protocols
- Self-Reflection Skills
- Jimminy (Oversight Layer)
- Navigator Guided Intake
- Call Script Generator
- Letter/Form Generator

## Why This Matters
- Provable prior art
- Future patent leverage
- Defensive publication
- Grant narrative authority
- Immunity against "we invented this" copycats

Future-proofs HearthMind if any primitives (Dock/Pier, CRL, continuity-aware AI, etc.) become common patterns later.
